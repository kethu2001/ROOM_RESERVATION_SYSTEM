The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is used to build this project. It is a common set of technologies for making web apps. It has Express.js as the web framework, React.js as the front-end package, and Node.js as the back-end processing environment. It utilizes MongoDB as the database.

The project is an app for managing tasks that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks. It provides users sign up, create tasks, give them, and keep track of their progress. The data collected from these functions is stored in MongoDB, a flexible.

The web frameworkÂ is Express.js, which lets you make RESTful APIs that connect the front end (React.js) to the back end (Node.js) and the database (MongoDB). As the front-end tool, React.js is used to make it possible to create a dynamic and interacting user experience. It changes data quickly and easily without having to restart the page, so the user experience is smooth.
